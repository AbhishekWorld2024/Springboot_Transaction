# Springboot_Transaction
<p>The @Transactional annotation is the metadata used for managing transactions in the Spring Boot application. To configure Spring Transaction, this annotation can be applied at the class level or method level. In an enterprise application, a transaction is a sequence of actions performed by the application that together are pipelined to perform a single operation. For example, booking a flight ticket is also a transaction where the end user has to enter his information and then make a payment to book the ticket.</p><br><br>
<p>In Spring Boot, @Transactional annotation is used to manage transactions in a Spring Boot application and to define a scope of transaction. This annotation can be applied to the class level or method level. It provides data reliability and consistency. When a method is indicated with @Transactional annotation, it indicates that the particular method should be executed within the context of that transaction. If the transaction becomes successful, then the changes made to the database are committed; if any transaction fails, all the changes made to that particular transaction can be rollback and it will ensure that the database remains in a consistent state.</p>
